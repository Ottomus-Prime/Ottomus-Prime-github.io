Idea:
  Implementing a commands page that has the ability to allow mods/streamer to add/remove commands, 
  rather than having the editing process work solely through JSON files.
  
Requirements:
  Converting existing project to NodeJS, and deployment using a service like Heroku
  Use EJS templating system for dynamic content rendering (maybe replace the jquery?)
  (use MVC model and be a PITA? or keep it simple?)

Overview:
  Main commands page (displays commands via jquery and json files) (done, old style)
  Admin page (add/remove commands via POST requests that send data to NodeJS)
  
Notes:
   Want to implement some form of security measure, such as a user/pass login system (but would require database format),
   or even just a passcode entry system (don't want to make it easy for someone to deface or delete stuff)

  Root Folder:
      --> public folder - holds files for public serves
          --> css folder - holds css files responsible for page styling
          --> data folder - holds json files that store command data
          --> scripts folder - holds script files (maybe replace by using ejs)
      --> routes folder - holds js files responsible for routing
          --> admin.js - route responsible for handling admin paths and views
          --> commands.js - route responsible for handling commands path and view
      --> views folder - holds ejs files responsible for html page generation
          --> admin.ejs - admin page html & logic
          --> commands.ejs - commands page html & logic
      --> app.js - responsible for spinning up the server, calling routes
